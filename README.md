NBA Draft Class Analysis: comparing player performance, longevity, and awards across decades

## Overview
This project analyzes NBA draft classes from 1990–2012 to identify which class produced the most successful players. 
The analysis considers player statistics (PPG, APG, RPG, VORP, Win Shares, FG%, FT%, 3PT%, BPM, Avg Years Played), major awards (MVP, All-Star, DPOY, Championships, FMVP, All-NBA), and career longevity. 
A custom dataset was created in Numbers to combine player statistics and awards.

## Objective
- Determine which NBA draft class is “the best” based on stats, awards, and career impact.
- Compare draft classes across 16 key categories.
- Explore differences between statistical performance and accolades.

## Tools & Skills
- R-Studio (tidyverse, dplyr, tidyr, ggplot2)
- Numbers for dataset creation
- Slideshow for presentation of findings
- Data cleaning, analysis, visualization, and storytelling

## Key Insights
- The 1996 draft class consistently led in multiple categories including VORP, All-Stars, All-NBA selections, Championships, and MVPs.
- The 2003 draft class excelled in awards but not in statistical categories.
- Some draft classes performed similarly across categories, highlighting the talent gap between others.
