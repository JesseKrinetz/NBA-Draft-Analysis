This project analyzes NBA draft classes from 1990–2012 to identify which class produced the most successful players. 
The analysis considers player statistics (PPG, APG, RPG, VORP, Win Shares, FG%, FT%, 3PT%, BPM, Avg Years Played), major awards (MVP, All-Star, DPOY, Championships, FMVP, All-NBA), and career longevity. 
A custom dataset was created in Numbers to combine player statistics and awards.
